ssh-server-manager
==================

Ever you tied up with keep in mind the messy server IP/hostname which have different user name to login and even some of them are using special port number (not standard 22) ?<br>
ssh-server manager is a bundle of scripts help to simplify those login information (IP/hostname, user, port) into short and esay-to-modify nicknames.

You'll definitely like this convenient way to login to servers and transfer files from/to them.

 - ssh-server.sh
 - ssh-to.sh
 - ssh-copyid.sh
 - receive-file-from.sh
 - send-file-to.sh

These scripts was part of <a herf=https://github.com/linfan/FreyrScripts>FreyrScripts</a> repository, they are pick out into separate repo because I find them really useful as a whole.
You may need to check it's previous location if you are looking for more historys about them.
